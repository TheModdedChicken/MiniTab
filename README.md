## Mini Tab

An alternate frontend for [Ultimate Guitar](https://ultimate-guitar.com/) / refitting of [Ultimate Tab](https://github.com/BenoitBellegarde/UltimateTab)

> [!WARNING] Work-in-progress
> This project is very incomplete and is currently **_NOT_** in a minimum viable state.

## Features

Mini Tab aims to be a fast, clean, and feature-rich alternative to other guitar tab viewers.

### Current

<details>
<summary><b>Web Scraping: No libraries</b></summary>

> While Ultimate Tab relies on Puppeteer to collect its data, Mini Tab only uses fetch requests, allowing for faster response times.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chords: Overhead and popup</b></summary>

> For some strange reason many alternative Ultimate Guitar frontends choose to have either overhead or popup chords, but never both. Mini Tab has both :)

</details>

### Planned

<details>

<summary><b>PWA / Offline</b></summary>

> In the future, Mini Tab will support offline usage. This means being able to download tab data, allowing it to act like a regular application.
